Problem/Data Domain

This description should be 1-2 paragraphs (~150-250 words) in length. Your overview should explain "what" the problem is and "why" it needs addressing (including why any currently existing apps are insufficient). You will need to include references to other resources to help clarify your explanation of this problem. 
Your proposal will contain a short description of the topic domain and the information/data you'll be presenting, explaining the problem to someone who doesn't know anything about it! Your description should include enough information to:
Provide an overview of the general topic or question of interest (e.g., "what is meant by 'homelessness' and why is it a particular problem in Seattle?").
How can we make information on  local Hawaiian businesses more accessible to tourists?
Identify an information technology problem in that space (e.g., "what information problems related to homelessness are unaddressed?").
It’s easy for tourists to find information about  brand hotels like Hilton or AirBnB but not Hawaiian local accommodation.
Need to promote local businesses for indigenous people of Hawaii
Identify at least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem (e.g., "what other web apps attempt to address homelessness? What has already been tried?")
The tourism industry fuels the Hawaiian economy, however, with millions of tourists entering the state each year it is critical for the native population and environment that tourists spend their money at local, Hawaiian owned businesses. Rather than supporting foreign tourism companies that do not help support the local population and disregard the urbanizing effects of their efforts, visitors should be well educated on the sustainable, locally-run businesses that are accessible to them on the islands. Unfortunately, this information is not readily available as large corporations have taken over the tourism industry. Current efforts, such as Shop Small Hawaii, provide resources for visitors to find local businesses on the islands. However, sites like this one are typically not interactive, and do not include enough information to be able to successfully plan an entire trip around. Our group’s goal is to create a one-stop site that provides all of the necessary resources and tools to plan an entirely sustainable trip that supports the Native Hawaiian population. 
 
 
In short: let us know what you are interested in, and identify a problem that you think needs solving (and that might be amenable to a technological intervention) while also considering what has come before.
While social injustices are the problems most worth attacking, your project could also address smaller, or more personal "problems". What is something that makes your life worse, and that you think that a web app might be able to help with?

App Description
Your proposal will also contain a description of the web app that you will create to help address your chosen problem (a proposed "solution"). Think about what kind of a web app would help with this problem, and how people would use that app to make their lives better in some way. What is the "use case" or "user story"

 for the app?
Remember that this app will be interactive—it will need to contain buttons, forms, etc that let the user provide some kind of input and modify how data is presented to them. Thus your app will need to do more than just be something for the user to read; it needs to give the user something to do.
Your app should also be described in 2-3 paragraphs. In particular, you should make sure to address:
Who are the users of the application? That is, who will be accessing the website? What impacts might this app have on minority groups?
The intended users will be tourists that are thinking about visiting Hawaii. They will be able to access the website to find and review local, indigenous owned businesses by region. Indigenous owned businesses in Hawaii can also use the website to promote their business. This will help the local economy  in the state of Hawaii where the money from tourists will stay on the islands.
What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interactive features are you expecting to provide? Remember that you app will need to include at least "two and a half" significant features; be sure to explicitly identify and explain what all of them are!
Users will be able to search the state of Hawaii by region to find local businesses within the area that they are touring. They can also access our interactive map, showing where those businesses are located in that region. Users will be able to view different accommodations, activities, food, and drinks within different regions of Hawaii. Lastly, we will  have a forum page that will allow tourists to post comments and share their experience at our businesses.
What kind of information will the users be viewing? If you're drawing data from an external source (a csv file or an API), include a link and citation to that data.
If you insist on using an API, confirm that you'll be able to access it from a client-side app by testing it at https://joelwross.github.io/cors-test/

How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? That is, how is it a solution to the problem you described?
This app will help shorten the inequality gap for Native Hawaiians who unproportionally bear the negative effects of tourism in their homeland but only receive a tiny fraction of the tourism income. Although Hawaii is well known for its beauty that attracted millions of tourists each year, most tourist weren’t aware of their impact on Native Hawaiians, who are struggling to keep up with the cost of living. We want to bring awareness of the importance of supporting local because it actually help people living in the community.
