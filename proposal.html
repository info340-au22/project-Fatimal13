    <h1>Problem/Data Domain</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Problem Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The tourism industry fuels the Hawaiian economy, however, with millions of tourists entering the state each
            year it is critical for the native population and environment that tourists spend their money at local,
            Hawaiian owned businesses. Rather than supporting foreign tourism companies that do not help support the
            local population and disregard the urbanizing effects of their efforts, visitors should be well educated on
            the sustainable, locally-run businesses that are accessible to them on the islands. Unfortunately, this
            information is not readily available as large corporations have taken over the tourism industry. Current
            efforts, such as Shop Small Hawaii, provide resources for visitors to find local businesses on the islands.
            However, sites like this one are typically not interactive, and do not include enough information to be able
            to successfully plan an entire trip around. Our group’s goal is to create a one-stop site that provides all
            of the necessary resources and tools to plan an entirely sustainable trip that supports the Native Hawaiian
            population.

        <h2>User Story</h2>
        <p>The intended users will be tourists that are thinking about visiting Hawaii. They will be able to access the
            website to find and review local, indigenous owned businesses by region. Indigenous owned businesses in
            Hawaii can also use the website to promote their business. This will help the local economy in the state of
            Hawaii where the money from tourists will stay on the islands.
            Users will be able to search the state of Hawaii by region to find local businesses within the area that
            they are touring. They can also access our interactive map, showing where those businesses are located in
            that region. Users will be able to view different accommodations, activities, food, and drinks within
            different regions of Hawaii. In order to create the maps we will use <a
                href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tiger-line-shapefile-2016-state-hawaii-current-county-subdivision-state-based">shapefile
                datasets</a>
            to develop interactive maps to include on our site.Lastly, we will have a forum page that will allow
            tourists to post comments and
            share their experience at our businesses.

        <h2>Purpose & Impact</h2>
        <p>
            This app will help shorten the inequality gap for Native Hawaiians who unproportionally bear the negative
            effects of tourism in their homeland but only receive a tiny fraction of the tourism income. Although Hawaii
            is well known for its beauty that attracted millions of tourists each year, most tourist weren’t aware of
            their impact on Native Hawaiians, who are struggling to keep up with the cost of living. We want to bring
            awareness of the importance of supporting local because it actually help people living in the community.
